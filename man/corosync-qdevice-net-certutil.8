.TH COROSYNC-QDEVICE-NET-CERTUTIL 8 2016-06-28
.SH NAME
corosync-qdevice-net-certutil - tool to generate qdevice model net TLS certificates
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "corosync-qdevice-net-certutil [-i|-m|-M|-r|-s|-Q] [-c certificate] [-S ssh_command] [-C scp_command] [-n cluster_name]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B corosync-qdevice-net-certutil
is a frontend for NSS certutil used for generating client certificate for the net model of
qdevice.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -i
Initialize the QDevice Net NSS certificate database.
The default directory for the database is /etc/corosync/qdevice/net/. This directory
has to be writable by the current user. It needs the QNetd CA certificate passed as the
.B -c
parameter. This certificate can be found on the server running QNetd in the file
/etc/corosync/qnetd/nssdb/qnetd-cacert.crt.
.TP
.B -m
Import the cluster certificate and key from a pk12 file.
.TP
.B -r
Generate a certificate request. The certificate request is exported into
/etc/corosync/qdevice/net/qdevice-net-node.crq. It is necessary to
pass the cluster name using the
.B -n
parameter. The cluster name has to match the one defined in /etc/corosync/corosync.conf.
.TP
.B -M
Import a signed certificate and export a certificate with private key into
pk12 file.
.TP
.B -Q
Use ssh/scp to properly set both
.B corosync-qnetd
and
.B corosync-qdevice
certificates on all nodes. It's highly recommended that you use an ssh agent,
or ssh/scp will keep asking for a password - roughly 8 times the number of nodes.
.TP
.B -c
File with certificate to load.
.TP
.B -S
Alternative remote shell command to be use in place of ssh. If not specified, ssh is used.
.TP
.B -C
Alternative remote copy command to be use in place of scp. If not specified, scp is used.
.TP
.B -n
Name of the cluster.
