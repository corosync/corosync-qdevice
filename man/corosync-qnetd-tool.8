.TH COROSYNC-QNETD-TOOL 8 2025-04-09
.SH NAME
corosync-qnetd-tool \- corosync-qnetd control interface.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "corosync-qnetd-tool [-Hhlsv] [-c cluster_name] [-p qnetd_ipc_socket_path]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B corosync-qnetd-tool
is a frontend to the internal corosync-qnetd IPC. Its main purpose is to show important
information about the current internal state of
.B corosync-qnetd.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -H
Properly shutdown the
.B corosync-qnetd
process
.TP
.B -h
Display a short usage text
.TP
.B -l
List all clients connected to the
.B corosync-qnetd
process. The output is described in its own section below.
.TP
.B -s
Display status of the
.B corosync-qnetd
process.
.TP
.B -v
Display more verbose output for options
.B -l
and
.B -s
.TP
.B -c
Used only with the
.B -l
option. By default, information about all clients from all clusters is displayed, with
this option it's possible to filter information from a single cluster given the
.I cluster_name.
.TP
.B -p
Path to the
.B corosync-qnetd
communication socket.

.SH LIST COMMAND OUTPUT
.nf
Cluster "Cluster":
    Algorithm:          Fifty-Fifty split (KAP Tie-breaker)
    Tie-breaker:        Node with lowest node ID
    Node ID 1:
        Client address:         ::ffff:127.0.0.1:52000
        HB interval:            8000ms
        Configured node list:   1, 2
        Ring ID:                1.a00000000021b40
        Membership node list:   1, 2
        TLS active:             Yes (client certificate verified)
        Vote:                   No change (ACK)
 ...
.fi

The output contains a list of clusters. Each cluster has the cluster common options
.I Algorithm
(optionally with Keep Active Partition Tie Breaker information) and
.I Tie-breaker
as configured in the corosync.conf file. Information about nodes follows.
.I Client address
is the IP address and port of the client.
.I HB interval
is the heartbeat interval between
.B corosync-qnetd
and
.B corosync-qdevice
client. This interval depends on the
.B timeout
option that can be set in the corosync.conf file.
.I Configured node list
is the list of nodes configured in corosync.conf.
.I Ring ID
and
.I Membership node list
are self-explanatory.
.I TLS active
describes if an encrypted transport is used between server and client.
.I Vote
is last vote sent to
.B corosync-qdevice
client. The last ACK/NACK vote (if it exists) is in parentheses.
